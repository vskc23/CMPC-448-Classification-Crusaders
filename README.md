## Project Overview

In this project, "News Classification with Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Approach," we aimed to tackle the challenge of efficiently categorizing and understanding the vast volume of news content proliferating across various digital platforms. By experimenting with advanced neural network architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the XLNet transformer model, this project sets out to provide a nuanced and accurate classification of news articles based on their headlines and short descriptions.

### Key Features

- **Experimentation with Advanced Neural Networks**: Utilizing LSTM, CNN, and XLNet models to process and analyze news data.
- **Focus on Short Text Classification**: Specializing in classifying news based on concise headlines and short descriptions.
- **Efficiency in Handling Large-scale Data**: Designed to efficiently manage and categorize large volumes of digital news content.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch (for XLNet implementation)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
